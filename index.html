            <p class="white center">This collection of images is from a middle school located in Montgomery County, MD, one of the wealthiest counties in the country. These images depict a sixth-grade math classroom that has a cart full of laptops for the kids, a promethean smart-board, a document projector, and a google classroom virtual environment that hosts all the assignments, tests, and resources used by both the teacher and the students. In response to an interview question with the teacher he stated, “The school has more laptops than students, a smart board in every classroom, offers a digital literacy class that can replace a foreign language credit, and has tablets that students can sign out to use in the classroom or take home for weekend work.” When comparing this school to his previous employment in Prince Georges County, MD, a county labeled as lower class with a more diverse population, he said, “That school didn’t even have projectors or computers for all of the teachers, offered no technology resources for the students, and all work was done with old fashioned pencil, paper, and physical textbooks.” A technology gap is already being formed within these kids by the time they are 11 years old. </p>

            <p class="white center">These two images show the same kinds of technology that was being offered in the sixth-grade classroom from above on a store floor with their price tags. The least expensive laptops were still all over $200 and tablets started at about $100. You can imagine that for the students in schools who aren’t able to provide technology resources, which are most likely already in lower social class communities, the ability to go out and obtain the resources for themselves to try and minimize the gap can be extra costly. A high school teacher I interviewed, who works at an inner-city school in South Florida, did a brief survey of one of her classrooms for this project. With anonymity she asked the students who had a personal laptop or tablet at home, and who had a family computer or tablet at home they could use. Of the 27 responses, only 3 had their own tablet or laptop, and only 11 had a family owned computer or tablet.  </p>

The entire college process has almost been exclusively moved to electronic and online resources. In fact, according to collegeboard.org, many universities prefer to use electronic applications due to convenience, and even make the cost of applying less expensive for those that do so. This represents just another barrier for educational attainment for those without tech experiences.  </p>

I am using this as a hold me over, and will take another image as soon as possible to replace on the web page. <br><br>This image is of a UNC classroom that is not attached to a tech major. You can see that almost every student has at least one electronic device out in front of them. In a survey I conducted myself of current UNC students for a previous project, not a single student (from 46 responses) had a class that didn’t use an online resource. These resources included Sakai, Piazza, and personal professor websites. Therefore, in order to successfully complete a college course a student is required to utilize electronics and internet access, just to be able to turn assignments in, find class notes and readings, take exams, and even read the syllabus. Many universities have public technology available to use, but if a student wants to be able to work from home or on their own time they would have to own their own laptop. And, it is also common to take online exams in class, which has been done in Sociology 101, and a public computer at this point wouldn’t provide any help. </p>

None of the jobs from the photos are in the technology field. However, you can see that all of them have some aspect of required tech abilities. Many of these jobs had been done prior to the technology boom and could be completed without technology. But now, not only do they utilize technology, but they expect applicants to already have the skills and knowledge to perform these tasks, rather than offering to train them in those areas. In addition, these are all postings from online job ads, which has become the primary way of advertising job openings and accepting applications. For those that lack accessibility to technology, the potential for even finding a job is hindered, and then lacking these tech skills can directly affect the ability to upgrade their occupational status.   </p>

This image is not to brag or boast about finding a job or about flaunting the money I will be making. It is simply to show that I, someone who has always been subjected to technology, and have acquired technology skills, have the ability to obtain a decent occupational status that directly results in a higher income. According to an article written by Susie Poppick on Time.com, the national average for starting salary out of college is $50,556. The salary I was offered is about $10,000 above that and has the possibility of up to $20,000 in bonuses. This could be due to several factors, but when combining this information with an article by Aine Cain on BusinessInsider.com, which shows 6 of the 11 highest paying jobs out of college are in the technology field with many of the others being closely related, it is safe to say that technology skills can directly impact potential income. </p>

         <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
         <hr class="white">
         <p class="white">Throughout the class we learned about socio-economic status, which is the societies method of creating a class hierarchy that people are placed into based on several factors. There were primary objective factors, which included wealth, the full broad spectrum of someone’s assets minus their debts, income, the money coming in on a regular basis that is most associated with having a job, educational attainment, and occupational status. Then there were secondary subjective factors such as cultural capital, which are the skills, knowledge, and behaviors that can demonstrate cultural competence and showcase one’s social status, self-identification, and reputation. My project focused on the idea of where the access of technology resources and the learning of technical skills could fall within these factors that dictate socio-economic classing. My initial thought process was that it would fall into cultural capital. However, the more I researched, observed the real world, and spoke with people who witness how technology can impact people, I started to think with this technology revolution it could be coming closer and closer to becoming as objective and important as any of the objective factors.<br><br>
 My theory behind this hypothesis is that objective factors have two key features. The first is that they are measurable. We can know how much income someone has, and we can know exactly what education or job they have. The second is that they all directly impact each other. We learned that more wealth can lead to more opportunities to gain higher educational attainment, and higher educational attainment can lead to better job status, higher income, and eventually more wealth. It can be a full cycle. On the flip side, any of those factors lacking can lead to barriers to acquire the others. Throughout my project it became clear that technical resources and skills can also have these two features. For one, it can be measured. You can see exactly what technical resources someone has, and you can measure the level of skill they have with technology, and this is done all the time during job interviews or when applying for schools. In addition, the more important piece is that with how important and prevalent technology is becoming, it is directly affecting the ability to acquire the other primary factors in determining socio-economic status. More access to technology and learning technical skills can impact one’s ability to attain higher education, higher job status, income, and wealth, and again, the lack of tech resources and skills can make it more difficult to raise your status in those areas. <br><br>
Adding another major factor to determining socio-economic status is certainly an issue for society, rather than a trouble for a single person. This is because it impacts people across age, race, and gender, and is not secluded to a single place, as the entire country is placing more weight and importance on technology these days. An issue that can impact a child’s ability to learn early in school, and an adult later in life trying to find a new job, seems like it couldn’t be simply labeled a trouble for individuals. People who already are fortunate to have these resources and skills or are already set into a long-term career might not care about this issue. But, anyone who is still at a point in life that have school or career searching in front of them, or have children they are putting through school now, should care as it will continue to become more important in determining their opportunities to be mobile in their social status going forward. <br><br>
From the photos and the captions in this project, you can see how starting at an early age a gap can be created between those with technology assets and those without. Middle schools with more funding or more willingness to provide technology to students are allowing kids to begin to work with and learn the necessary technical skills required for future use. For children at the schools that aren’t as fortunate are already a step behind in creating opportunities going forward even if they are learning the same concepts in math, english, and history that used to be the core curriculum in years past. The future importance of these skills was seen in the fact that applying for schools and aid for college is now mostly done electronically through the internet. Therefore, kids who have been using laptops and working on the internet starting at 6th grade would be far more likely to know that these resources for getting into a college exist, and then be able to navigate them more efficiently, than the students who were never afforded those technical opportunities. Then, once in college, the same can be applied as many school resources, school assignments, and communication across students is also done with the same technologies. This depicts how educational attainment can be directly linked to someone’s exposure to technology. <br><br>
This might not be as big of a potential issue if it stopped at educational attainment, but the photos and captions also broadcast how it goes past that and impacts people’s chances at gaining a higher occupational status, and higher income, which can eventually lead to more wealth. This was seen with just the handful of job profiles that listed technical skill requirements for jobs that weren’t even linked to the technology field. Jobs that would once require phone skills, organization skills, communication skills, presentation skills, and others, now require those tasks and responsibilities to be done with technology. The same job title and role that someone without a history of technical capabilities could once attain, now might not meet the minimum requirements to even feel the ability to apply for the job much less get it. Lastly, the numbers show that average income for those with tech abilities, especially directly in the tech field, outweigh the numbers for those without tech abilities, and by quite a significant margin. This creates a gap in potential income earned for those with versus those without tech assets, and this can go a long way in eventually creating a larger wealth gap.<br><br>
This project was important to me because I am in the tech field. I was extremely fortunate to come up in a place that predicted the booming importance of technology and trained me early, and I followed it up by using those skills to help me get into a prestigious university and attain a job that gives me great opportunities going forward. However, I have never taken that for granted, and had witnessed the alternate scenario for those that didn’t have the opportunities I had. I felt to end my academic career here it would be important to reiterate this to myself by going further into identifying this issue. It has opened my eyes even further, and maybe one day I can even be a part of trying to minimize this growing technology gap. <br><br>
As for completing this project, I knew I wanted to get pictures that were directly tied to the other objective factors of socio-economic status. I wanted to portray a storyline from early education all the way through getting a job and earning money. I started by taking the pictures I could do myself, like the college classroom picture, the store picture, and the picture of me and my job offer. I then reached out to those who were in a school environment. I was fortunate to know so many teachers that could help me obtain my pictures and information. I am not overly satisfied that I only have four live pictures and the rest are screenshots or another form of images, but I couldn’t find a way around it when telling the other pieces of the story. I hope by having multiple images it could make up for that aspect. Overall, I can say I learned a lot and am very happy that I enrolled in the class, selected this topic, and expanded my sociological imagination.
